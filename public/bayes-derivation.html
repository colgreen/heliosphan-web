      <b>Drawing Balls from a Bag</b>
      <p>There is a bag with four wooden balls in it. To 'sample' from the bag we jumble up the contents, reach in, and take
        out one of the balls. After observing the ball we put it back into the bag (sampling with replacement) so that we
        can continue taking samples ad infinitum.
      </p>
      <p>The balls have two distinguishing attributes, their colour and the presence or absence of a spot; the attributes are
        arranged like so:</p>
      <table border="1" cellpadding="4" align="center">
        <tr>
          <th></th>
          <th>Colour</th>
          <th>Has Spot</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Ball 1</th>
          <td>Red</td>
          <td>N</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Ball 2</th>
          <td>Red</td>
          <td>N</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Ball 3</th>
          <td>Red</td>
          <td>Y</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>ball 4</th>
          <td>Blue</td>
          <td>Y</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <br/>
      <p>Three balls are red, one is blue.</p>
      <p>Two balls have a spot, two don't.</p>
      <br/>

      <b>Some Elementary Probability Calculations</b>

      <p>At this point we can calculate some simple probabilities. There are four balls and no way to tell them apart or cheat,
        so the probability of drawing any one ball is the same as for any other ball, and is always 1/4 = 25% = 0.25. We
        can write this as:</p>

      <p>$${P}(ball1) = {P}(ball2) = {P}(ball3) = {P}(ball4) = \frac{1}{count(all)} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 $$</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Half of the balls have a spot, so the probability of drawing a ball with a spot is 50%; we write this as:</p>

      <p>$${P}(spot) = \frac{count(spot)}{count(all)} = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5$$</p>
      <br/>

      <p>We do the same again with the ball colour:</p>

      <p>$${P}(red) = \frac{count(red)}{count(all)} = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75 \tag{1}$$</p>
      <br/>
      <p>$${P}(blue) = \frac{count(blue)}{count(all)} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 $$</p>
      <br/>

      <p>Since a ball must be red or blue, and cannot be both red and blue, we can also state:</p>
      <p>$$ {P}(red) + {P}(blue) = 1 $$</p>
      <p>Or equivalently:</p>
      <p>$$ {P}(red) = 1 - {P}(blue)$$</p>
      <p>$$ {P}(blue) = 1 - {P}(red)$$</p>
      <br/>
      <p>We can also ask - what is the probability of drawing a red ball with a spot? Again, we just count the number of balls
        that meet our test condition and divide by the total number of balls:</p>
      <p>$$ {P}(red, spot) = \frac{count(red \ and\ spot)}{count(all)} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 \tag{2}$$</p>
      <p>And so on.</p>
      <br/>

      <b>Conditional Probabilities</b>

      <p>A conditional probability is just the probability of some thing given that we already know something else. E.g. A friend
        draws a ball without showing it to us and tells us it is red; what is the probability of it having a spot?</p>

      <p>We know there are three red balls, one of which has a spot, so:</p>

      <p>$$ P(spot | red) = \frac{count(red \ and\ spot)}{count(red)} = \frac{1}{3} = 0.3\overline{3} \tag{3} $$</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Note that the denominator is now three, not four as before. We know that a red ball was drawn, and there are only three
        of them, i.e. we eliminated the blue ball from our set of possibilties
      </p>
      <br/>


      <b>Bayes</b>

      <p>Equation 3 has two counts on the right hand side that also occured in equations 1 and 2, in fact if we divide equation
        2 by equaion 1 we get:</p>


      <p>$$ \frac{P(red, spot)}{P(red)} = \frac{count(red \ and\ spot)}{count(red)} $$</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Note that the side of the equation with counts in also appears in equation 3, therefore we can write:</p>

      <p>$$ \frac{P(red, spot)}{P(red)} = P(spot | red) \tag{4}$$</p>
      <br/>

      <p>This pretty much captures Bayes Theroem but it's not quite the full Bayes rule in its commonly stated form; we need
        to apply one further rule:</p>

      <p>$$ P(red, spot) = P(spot, red) \tag{5}$$</p>
      <br/>

      <p>Here we're just saying that the probability of drawing a ball that is both red and has a spot, is the same as drawing
        one that has a spot and is red; it's so obvious you might think why even mention it? Because, if we go through all
        of the above derivation with the 'red' and 'spot' terms swapped then we end up with this alternative version of equation
        4:</p>

      <p>$$ \frac{P(spot, red)}{P(spot)} = P(red | spot) \tag{6}$$</p>
      <br/>

      <p>Combining equations 4, 5 and 6, we can rearrange to get:</p>

      <p>$$ \frac{P(spot | red)}{P(red)} = \frac{P(red | spot)}{P(spot)} \tag{Bayes' Rule} $$</p>
      <br/>
      <p>That is the easy to remember 'balanced' form; to get to the commonly stated form just rearrange like so:</p>
      <p>$$ P(spot | red) = \frac{P(red | spot)P(red)}{P(spot)} \tag{Bayes' Rule}$$</p>
      <br/>

      <p>(I'm open to suggestions towards improving the clarity of the above)</p>
